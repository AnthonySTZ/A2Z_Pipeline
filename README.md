## Maya Plugin

### Save

If the current maya scene is not saved, it will open an **A2Z SaveAs window**. Using this window, you can choose the **project**, the **department** and the **type** of scene.
You can choose to **publish** the scene, that will save your scene into a publish folder.   
You can also add a thumbnail to the scene, using the **Screenshot** button to take a screenshot of your current view in maya or using the **Browse** button to choose an image in your file explorer.
